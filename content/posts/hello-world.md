Hello World.

That's the best greeting that could come from someone in tech ! :)

This blog happens to be an item from my 2018 To-Do list where I can share all 
my tech learnings. Expect topics on Cloud Native Architectures, Containers,
Distributed Computing and Site Reliability Engineering

Let 2018 be filled with knowledge sharing, open-source participation, conferences
and tech talks !
